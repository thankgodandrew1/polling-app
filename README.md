# Overview - Pollin App

A real-time polling application where authenticaed users can create and participate in polls. Polling App is a JavaScript program.


As a software developer, continual learning and the ability to build functional applications is essential. This project represents my endeavor to create a functional polling application, integrating modern web technologies, real-time polls updates, and user authentication using Google.

This polling application allows users to create polls with multiple options, vote on existing polls, and view results in real-time. The application uses Socket.IO for real-time communication, MongoDB for data storage, and Google OAuth for user authentication.

The purpose of creating this software was to enhance my skills in full-stack development, particularly focusing on real-time web applications and user authentication mechanisms.

# Development Environment
I used the following tools and technologies to develop this software:

*Visual Studio Code:* An Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
*Node.js:* A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
*Express.js:* A web application framework for Node.js.
*Socket.IO:* A library for real-time web applications.
*MongoDB:* A NoSQL database for storing poll and user data.
*Mongoose:* An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
*Passport.js:* An authentication middleware for Node.js.
*Google OAuth:* For user authentication via Google accounts.
*HTML/CSS/JavaScript:* For client-side development.
*dotenv:* For managing environment variables.
